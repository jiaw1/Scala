  * as `Moment` objects. An interval always contains at least a single moment.
  *
  * An interval object may be used to represent a range of years, a range of months, etc.,
  * as desired
  *
  * An `Interval` object is immutable after it has been created. That is, its state
  * can not be changed in any way.

  * @param start  the start of the interval (that is, the first moment included in the interval)
  * @param end    the end of the interval (that is, the last moment included in the interval);
