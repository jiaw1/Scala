/** Each instance of class `GameState` represents a single state within the Peeveli variant of
  * Hangman: What does the (partially visible) target word look like to the guesser? How many
  * incorrect guesses can the guesser still make? Which guesses have already been made? Moreover,
  * our dishonest hangman needs an additional piece of information: Which words are still credible
  * solutions given the earlier guesses?
  *
  * Chapter 9.3 of the ebook has a detailed discussion of the internal logic of the Peeveli game.
  *
  * While a player plays a game of Peeveli, the game will move from one state to another. Even so,
  * each `GameState` object is immutable. Each successive state is represented by a new `GameState`
  * object, which is generated by calling the current state's `guessLetter` method.
  *
  * @param missesAllowed      the number of incorrect guesses that the guesser can still make before
  *                           losing the game. A negative number means that the game is over.
  * @param previousGuesses    a string that contains all the previously guessed characters in order
  * @param visibleWord        the version of the target word that is visible to the guesser. In a
  *                           state that represents the beginning of the game, this will consist
  *                           of unrevealed characters only (e.g., `"_____"`; see [[GameState$ Unrevealed]]).
  *                           In later states, more and more characters will be visible (e.g., `"C___O"`).
  * @param possibleSolutions  all the words in the game's vocabulary that match the `visibleWord`
  *                           parameter and are therefore plausible correct solutions */
