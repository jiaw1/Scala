    * a wall or another bot in the chosen direction, the lovebot will collide with it
    * (as per [[RobotBody.moveTowards the `moveTowards` method of its body]], possibly
    * colliding and breaking itself or another robot).
    *
    * The path of movement is chosen as follows. First the lovebot calculates its distance
    * to its target in both the x and y dimensions. It moves one square at a time so that
    * either the horizontal (x) or the vertical (y) distance decreases by one, choosing
    * the one that is greater. In case the distances are equal, the horizontal distance
    * is chosen. The lovebot only moves one square per turn. It turns to face the
    * direction it attempts to move in, even if that attempt fails because of a collision.
    * The bot does not turn or move if it is already close enough to its beloved.
    *
    * This method assumes that it is called only if the robot is not broken or stuck. */
